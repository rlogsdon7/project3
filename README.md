# Project 3: TV-Time

Project 3 aims to create interactive and responsive data visualizations using web-scraped transcripts from a TV show and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/). For our project, we decided to use transcripts from [The Simpsons](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096697/).

### Data

The transcripts and dataset used in this project was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prashant111/the-simpsons-dataset?resource=download). The data scraper was initially developed by [Todd Schneider](https://github.com/toddwschneider/flim-springfield). This project also utilizes [The Simpsons Wiki](https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Simpsons_Wiki) API and [TVmaze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api).

### Tools

The visualizations included in this project were created using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).

This project was developed using primarily JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

### Features

This project includes the following visualizations:

- Bar chart: Interactive bar-chart displaying characters and their total number of lines.
- Histogram: Interactive histogram displaying number of lines per episode, colored by season.
- Word Cloud: Displays the most common words for either the entire show or the current filter.
- Chord Diagram: Visualizes the number of lines spoken between two characters.
- Line Chart: Displays the frequency of a particular word across a range of episodes. 

## Usage

To run this project locally, clone the `main` branch of this repository and open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The data will be loaded automatically and the visualizations will be displayed on the screen.
